**Code Optimizer üöÄ**

Welcome to the Code Optimizer repository! This tool is designed to help you optimize your code effortlessly. By leveraging the power of two Language Models (LLMs) in the backend, this software provides cutting-edge optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and performance of your code.

## Features

üîç **Intelligent Analysis**: Our advanced LLMs analyze your code to identify areas for optimization, including redundant functions, inefficient algorithms, and more.

üõ†Ô∏è **Automatic Optimization**: With just a click, the Code Optimizer automatically applies optimizations to your code, saving you time and effort.

‚ö° **Performance Boost**: By optimizing your code, you'll experience significant performance improvements, resulting in faster execution times and reduced resource usage.

üîÑ **Version Control Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with popular version control systems like Git to manage and track optimizations across your codebase.

üîí **Security Checks**: The Code Optimizer includes security checks to ensure that optimizations do not compromise the integrity or security of your code.
